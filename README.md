# Departures

A standalone watchOS app built with SwiftUI for learning and fun. It shows upcoming transit departures for various stations in Berlin.

## Limitations

- Stations are currently hard-coded. I'll add basic station management when I find the time :nerd_face:
- Auto-reloading departures doesn't work yet, as I ran into some issues with screen-based timers in SwiftUI
